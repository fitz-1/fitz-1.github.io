            Growing up camping, skiing, and exploring the outdoors, Claire understands how the right gear can transform an adventure. With a background in product and apparel design, along with a love for hands-on problem solving, she helped bring the Nova Tent from early sketches to the final stitch. Her attention to detail, creative mindset, and sewing experience all came together to refine the tent's structure and user experience. For Claire, designing the Nova Tent was about more than just functionality, it was about making outdoor adventures easier, more comfortable, and a lot more fun.

            Fitz believes good gear should never get in the way of a great adventure. With a background in creative tech, hands-on design, and a serious obsession with the outdoors, he's the one behind the Nova Tent's stitches, structure, and spirit. Whether patterning fabric, fixing busted gear, or chasing clear skies, Fitz brings a mix of precision, problem-solving, and pure stoke to every project. Building the Nova Tent wasn't just about making something functional â€” it was about creating a launchpad for more nights outside, more spontaneous trips, and more stories under the stars.
