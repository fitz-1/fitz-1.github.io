          <p class="mentor-bio">
            Mike Cecot-Scherer is the owner and operator of TheTentLab, bringing over 45 years of experience in the specialty outdoor industry. 
            With a professional design career spanning since 1985, Mike has designed an impressive 266 tents to date, with more in development. 
            His extensive background includes 10 years in retail, 16 years as the in-house designer for Kelty, and 17 years of freelance design work.
          </p>

          <p class="mentor-bio">
            Mike's expertise is grounded in both practical experience and technical knowledge. A graduate of UC Berkeley with a degree in Physics, 
            he combines his technical understanding with extensive personal experience in hiking, skiing, backpacking, climbing, and biking. 
            His design philosophy is shaped by years of personal use in various environments worldwide, discussions with users about their needs, 
            and a deep understanding of how outdoor gear functions in real-world conditions.
          </p>


          <p class="mentor-bio">
            Throughout the development of the Nova Tent project, Mike has provided invaluable guidance in material selection, structural design, 
            and testing. His wealth of experience in tent design and manufacturing has been instrumental in helping us create a product that 
            balances innovation with practical functionality. His mentorship has been particularly valuable in navigating the complex challenges 
            of tent design while maintaining focus on user experience and performance.
